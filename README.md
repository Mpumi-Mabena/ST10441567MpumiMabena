The purpose of the app is to remember the people who have created the
way for us and took to the streets and fought for the freedom of the
people and their children as well. The people who are interested in
history and want to know about these historians deaths and what they
were known for. It will give them information that they can use for
their research or project. This will benefit people for their research
topics or when they want to know about those who fought for the freedom
of the people and their human rights as well.

Design considerations

Intuitive Design

The design is easy to follow from Top to Bottom as users would expect it
to be.

Content Prioritisation

The app has all the key elements that are needed for it to work. I
incorporated the essential content and functionalities the user needs.

Legible text content

I used calibri body which makes it easier for the user to read. The text
is in a justified size for the user to see.

Make Interface Elements Clearly Visible

Yes, It is not too crowded but the buttons have too much space between
them due to the constraints.

Hand Position controls

The buttons are not in a position where it will be easy to reach by
users because they are spaced out due to the constraints.

Image

The reason why is because I look up to Martin Luther King Jr and his
speeches motivated me to try and work hard every day. The reason why I
put it in the centre is because I would like the user using this app to
know whom this image is of.
